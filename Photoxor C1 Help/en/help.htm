<p>Photoxor C1 is a photography tool for <strong>exposure</strong> and
<strong>depth of field</strong> calculations. Use the device camera based
lightmeter to estimate an Exposure Value (EV) reading, determine camera
settings and calculate adjustments needed for a (neutral density) filter.</p>

<p>The Depth of Field calculation shows the near and far limits of sharpness,
and additionally provides a graphical visualisation of the level of sharpness
and diffraction. The Circle of Confusion (CoC) is automatically calculated from
the camera sensor size, but may be overridden with a custom value.</p>

<p>The Depth of Field calculation now also allows specifying the range of
sharpness (near and far limits) and calculates the needed camera settings.</p>

<p>Now location tracking is available to record your travelling.</p>

<p>The key features are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aperture, time, ISO<br />
    Exposure calculations and Exposure Value (EV)</li>
  <li>Lightmeter (using device camera)</li>
  <li>ND filters and &ldquo;Black Glass&rdquo;<br />
    Calculation on how a ND filter light reductions affects exposure
  settings</li>
  <li>Depth of Field calculations with graphical presentation of distance
    dependent sharpness level (CoC)</li>
  <li>Depth of Field reverse calculation<br/>
    Camera settings are determined based on required near and far sharpness limits
  </li>
  <li>Field of View calculation<br/>
	Both dimensional and angular<br/>
	also dimensional reverse calculation
  </li>
  <li>Define own cameras and custom Circle of Confusion (CoC)</li>
  <li>Define own filter characteristics (light reduction)</li>
  <li>Set your stop system (full, ½, 1/3, ¼ stops)</li>
  <li>Customize light wavelength for diffraction calculation (Airy Disk)</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of in-app purchases are now available to further extend capabilities:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Advertisement free:</strong> Get more screen space by removing the advertisement banner.</li>
 <li><strong>High Precision:</strong> An essential feature for the serious photographer!<br/>
Get your calculation outputs (depth of field, field of view) in high precision - configure between 2 and 8 significant digits results.
</li>
 <li><strong>Filter Stack:</strong> Define multiple stacked (neutral density) filters and calculate the resulting effect.</li>
</ul>
